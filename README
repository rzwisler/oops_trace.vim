This script lets you use tag-style lookups (i.e. C-] ) on Linux kernel oops
stack traces.  For this to work, you need the following:
1) The log file with the stack trace needs to be recognized as having
   filetype=messages, which is hopefully the default.  If not, run 
'set filetype=messages'.
2) You need to have built your kernel with debug symbols
   (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y).
3) Vim needs to have its PWD in your Linux build directory, or you need to
   set up the g:oops_path global variable to your build directory.  i.e.:
   let g:oops_path='/home/myuser/linux-kernel'
